## snprintf() in c

snprintf() is a function in the C programming language that stands for "secure printf()". It is used to format and store a series of characters and values in a specified buffer. The primary purpose of snprintf() is to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities that can occur when using sprintf().

Syntax:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
Parameters:
str: Pointer to the buffer where the resulting formatted string will be stored.
size: Maximum number of characters to be written to str, including the terminating null byte ('\0'). This limits the length of the resulting string.
format: C string that contains the text to be written to str. It can optionally contain format specifiers that are replaced by the values specified in subsequent additional arguments, which are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.
Return Value:
Upon successful completion, snprintf() returns the number of characters that would have been written if the size had been sufficiently large, excluding the terminating null byte.
If the return value is greater than or equal to size, it means that the output was truncated. This can help detect if the buffer size was insufficient.
Example Usage:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[50];
    int num = 123;
    float f = 456.789;

    // Example of snprintf usage
    int length = snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "Integer: %d, Float: %.2f", num, f);
    
    if (length >= sizeof(buffer)) {
        printf("Output was truncated.\n");
    }

    printf("Formatted string: %s\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
In this example:

snprintf() formats the string "Integer: 123, Float: 456.79" into the buffer, respecting the format specifiers %d and %.2f.
It ensures that the formatted output does not exceed the size of the buffer, preventing buffer overflow.
The return value length indicates the number of characters that would have been written if there were enough space in the buffer.
Using snprintf() is generally recommended over sprintf() because it provides a safer way to handle string formatting and prevents common security vulnerabilities associated with buffer overflows.
